How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
It could pinpoint the locations in the file where edits where made to make comparing the files easier, and faster.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
I could see where I've been making mistakes, or where i could change/tighten up my code to be more efficient.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
PROS: being able to save at the right time, with the right amout of logcial change
CONS: user error, going to long without commiting can be a bad thing

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Because each was created to manage different types of files. Files being saved in google, like word, excel and pdfs usually are not associated with each other.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
git log shows all the changes and git diff allows you to compare and see where the changes where made

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
because knowing that you can go back easily will allow for trying new things without permanently breaking it.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
helping me debug projects
